# 🍔 Full‑Stack Food Ordering Platform

A **production‑ready full‑stack food ordering application** built with **Next.js App Router**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Stripe**.
This project demonstrates **real‑world backend architecture**, **secure payment handling**, and **scalable database design** — exactly how modern e‑commerce systems are built.

> ⚠️ This is **not a demo or tutorial app**. It follows **industry best practices** used in real production systems.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

* Designing **secure payment systems** with Stripe
* Building **server‑trusted pricing logic** (anti‑fraud)
* Modeling complex relational data with Prisma
* Writing scalable, transaction‑safe backend code
* Structuring a clean, maintainable Next.js App Router project

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🛒 Product catalog with **categories, sizes & extras**
* 🧮 **Server‑side price calculation** (client cannot manipulate totals)
* 💳 **Stripe Payment Intents** (Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
* 🔔 **Stripe Webhooks** as the single source of truth
* 📦 Order lifecycle management (`PENDING → PAID → DELIVERED`)
* 🔐 Zod validation for all critical inputs
* ⚡ Optimized database queries (no N+1 issues)
* 🧾 Transaction‑safe order creation

## 🔐 Payment Architecture (Industry‑Standard)

```
Client Checkout
   ↓
Create PaymentIntent (Server)
   ↓
Confirm Payment (Client)
   ↓
Stripe Webhook
   ↓
Create PAID Order (Server)
```

✔ Orders are **never created before payment succeeds**
✔ Stripe is the **source of truth**
✔ Webhooks guarantee reliability even if the client disconnects

## 👨‍💻 Mohamed Khaled

This project was built to showcase **real backend & full‑stack engineering skills**, focusing on **correct architecture**, **security**, and **scalability** rather than UI demos.

If you’re a recruiter or hiring manager, this repository reflects how I approach **production‑level systems**.
